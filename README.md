# So here is how to use this template

## Installations

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Two packages are required, discord.js and nodemon
* ```npm install discord.js ```
* ```npm install nodemon```

## Changes

* For any command you want to include, create a new file by ][commandName].js (a demo template is given)
* Help command will work on its own, do not worry :)
* Enter KEY and PREFIX in config.json within the config folder
* Everything else will take care of itself :) XD

## Run

* To run, use 
``` npm run dev ```
* Dont worry about saving changes, nodemon will restart the server everytime you save your files.
